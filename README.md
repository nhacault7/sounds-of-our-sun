Our project "Sounds of our Sun"  takes real time data from the ACE SWEPAM module to convert data on the Radial Spin, Density, and Temperature of the Suns plasma into tones. You can use the data from these three points to control Low, Middle, and High Pitches as well as the volume and pitch oscilation.

We believe this is a fun way to interact with scientific data about our sun and with our easy to use interface it is great for everyone of all ages. Since the space probe only updates every minute we figured what better way to pass that time then listening to some cool tunes made by our very own sun!
